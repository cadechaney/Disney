## Learning Goals:

-Build a multi-page application using React Router, an api of my choosing, and a new technology
-Put to practice everything I've learned about typescript

## Challenges and Wins:

-I originally had the cards to be flipped on a hover effect. This didn't end up working with my learning goals of
using cypress. To work through this I had to change the styling of my application, which ended up working out.

## Future Feature Ideas:

-Bring back the card flip styling. Make outputs from the api filter through a default to avoid empty information on the DOM

## Installation Instructions:

-Clone down this repo
-Install dependencies by using ‘npm install’ in your terminal within the root directory
-To host website on your local machine, run ’npm start’ in terminal
-A window should be opened in your default browser, if not, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser to view the hosted application

## Testing Instructions:

To run the test suite associated with the classes behind the scenes and how they interact: Run 'npm run cypress' from the terminal while within the main directory of the application and select E2E Testing, and your chosen browser in the following window.
